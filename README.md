Comparison of different Machine Learning Models performance in detecting Breast Cancer

According to global statistics, breast cancer (BC) is one of the most frequent malignancies among women globally. Early detection of BC improves the prognosis and chances of survival by allowing patients to get timely therapeutic therapy. Patients may avoid unneeded therapies if benign tumors are classified more precisely. Motivated by this, in our work, using BC dataset we classify whether a person has malignant tumor or benign tumor using logistic regression, KNN classifier, support vector machine, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification models and compare their performances to determine which is the best model for this problem.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39513300/180848789-caea3d9e-0d9e-47ac-95e7-8c1b4f0f0c93.png)
